# Beacon-Test
iPhone app to test the functionality and data analysis of an Estimate Beacon

This is my first iPhone app using the Estimote beacon technology. It is intended to test the functionality of the beacon, such as entering/exiting a monitored region, collecting relevant data from the sensors, estimating proximity to an object, and more. It is currently a very barebones app, but I will continue to add more features as I test the capabilities of the beacon.

The app was created using Swift and XCode.
